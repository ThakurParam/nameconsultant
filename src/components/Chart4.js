            The first step that is required of you is to get an affidavit from
            the notary office, fill out the document, submit the documents that
            are required by the notary office, and follow their steps properly.
          </p>
          <h3>Types Of Affidavit</h3>
          <h3>Change Of Name Affidavit</h3>
          <p>
            This affidavit form requires you to fill in your old name or maiden
            name, new name, current address, age and the reason for the change
            in name.
          </p>

            This affidavit is used for those who want to change their names
            after marriage. Along with a filled up form, a copy of the marriage
            certificate and photographs of yourself and your spouse need to be
            submitted.
          </p>
          <h3>Affidavit For Change Of Name On The Passport</h3>
          <p>
            The affidavit is used in cases of change of name on a passport due
            to spelling mistakes or change in surname after marriage. The
            procedure is the same as a change of name.

            minors. The affidavit needs to be presented by the parents or
            guardians. The other procedures remain the same.
          </p>
          <h3>Step 2: Publication Of Newspaper</h3>
          <p>
            After submitting your affidavit, it is your time to publish your
            name through an article. You can make this announcement by any of
            the two newspapers, either by your Native language newspaper or
            English newspaper. This is an important step that cannot be ignored.
          </p>
          <h5>Some Important point to include in the Newspaper Publication:</h5>
